In this implementation:

We use a generic type T to allow the queue to store elements of any type.
We maintain an array arr to store the elements of the queue.
front and rear indices track the position of the front and rear elements 
of the queue, respectively.
capacity specifies the maximum number of elements the queue can hold.
count keeps track of the number of elements currently in the queue.
Enqueue adds an item to the rear end of the queue, and Dequeue removes
an item from the front end.
Peek returns the item at the front end without removing it.
IsEmpty and IsFull methods check if the queue is empty or full, respectively.
