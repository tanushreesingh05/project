Multidimensional Arrays

The multi-dimensional array contains more than one row to store the values. It is also known as a Rectangular Array in C# because it’s each row length is same. It can be a 2D-array or 3D-array or more. To storing and accessing the values of the array, one required the nested loop. The multi-dimensional array declaration, initialization and accessing is as follows :

// creates a two-dimensional array of 
// four rows and two columns.
int[, ] intarray = new int[4, 2];

//creates an array of three dimensions, 4, 2, and 3
int[,, ] intarray1 = new int[4, 2, 3];
