A LinkedList is a linear data structure which stores element
in the non-contiguous location. The elements in a linked list 
are linked with each other using pointers. Or in other words,
LinkedList consists of nodes where each node contains a data 
field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list. 
In C#, LinkedList is the generic type of collection which 
is defined in System.Collections.Generic namespace.
It is a doubly linked list, therefore, each node points
forward to the Next node and backward to the Previous node. 
It is a dynamic collection which grows, according to the need
of your program. It also provides fast inserting and removing
elements.
