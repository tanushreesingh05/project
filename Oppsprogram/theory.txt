What is a Queue?
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO)
principle. In a queue, elements are inserted at the rear end (enqueue) and
removed from the front end (dequeue). This means that the element that has
been in the queue the longest is the one to be removed first.

Key Characteristics:
FIFO Principle: The first element inserted into the queue will be
the first one to be removed.
Two Main Operations:
Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear end of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes and returns the element from the front end of the queue.
Peek Operation: Retrieves the element at the front end of the queue 
without removing it.
Implementation:
Queue can be implemented using various underlying data structures
like arrays, linked lists, or dynamic arrays.
In C#, the Queue<T> class from the System.Collections.Generic namespace
is commonly used for implementing queues.
